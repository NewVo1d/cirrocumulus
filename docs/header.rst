Cirrocumulus for Single-Cell Data Visualization
=================================================

Cirrocumulus is an interactive visualization tool for large-scale single-cell genomics data, with the following key features:

* Run on a laptop, on-premise server, cloud VM, or Google App Engine
* View spatial transcriptomics data overlaid on an image
* Share the current visualization state in a URL
* Share datasets securely with collaborators
* Create dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots to explore relationships between categorical variables and expression
* Explore complete differential expression results generated by `Scanpy`_ or `Pegasus`_
* Interactively create and share “AND” or “OR” filters
* Collaboratively annotate cell types in real time
* Quickly load multiple features from predefined lists
* Explore multiple features and embeddings simultaneously
* Fast interactive exploration of 2 and 3-d embeddings of millions of cells, including zoom, pan, rotate (3-d), and lasso tools
* Save publication quality images
* Highly customizable - for example, set the color map, point size, or whether to use fog for 3-d embeddings to fade distant points
* Visualize datasets in h5ad_, loom_, Seurat_, or `STAR-Fusion`_  formats
