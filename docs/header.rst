Cirrocumulus for Single-Cell Data Visualization
=================================================

Cirrocumulus is an interactive visualization tool for large-scale single-cell genomics data, with the following key features:

* Run on a laptop, on-premise server, cloud VM, or Google App Engine
* View spatial transcriptomics data overlaid on an image
* Share the current visualization state in a URL
* Scale to > 6 million cells on commodity hardware
* Share datasets securely with collaborators
* Create dotplots to explore relationships between categorical variables and expression
* Interactively create and share “AND” or “OR” filters
* Collaboratively annotate cell types in real time
* Quickly load multiple features from predefined lists
* Explore multiple features and embeddings simultaneously
* Fast interactive exploration of 2-d and 3-d embeddings including zoom, pan, rotate (3-d), lasso, and brush tools
* Save publication quality images
* Highly customizable - for example, set the color map, point size, or whether to use fog for 3-d embeddings to fade distant points
* Visualize STAR-Fusion results alongside single cell expression
